# chip8

**Description**
  - A XO-Chip (Chip8 + Octo Extensions) emulator/interpreter written in c using the CSFML library for IO.
  - CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)
